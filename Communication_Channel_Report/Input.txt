But there is another thing: we are not only scientists; we are men, too. We cannot forget our dependence on our fellow men. 
I mean not only our material dependence, without which no science would be possible, 
and without which we could not work; I mean also our deep moral dependence, 
in that the value of science must lie in the world of men, that all our roots lie there. 
These are the strongest bonds in the world, stronger than those even that bind us to one another, 
these are the deepest bonds—that bind us to our fellow men.
